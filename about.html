            <p>Hello!  My name is Tyler Bowman and I am currently a student at Nashville Software School.  I am in Cohort 22.  Before I came to NSS I was a high School U.S. History teacher.                   I went to Trevecca Nazarene University where I earned a bachelors degree in Music Education.</p>
            
            <p>I gained a love of all things technological from an early age.  I am a computer nerd and love video games, especially when they invole puzzles and problem solving.</p>  
            
            <p>As a kid I always loved building things.  Every birthday or Christmas all I wanted were Legos.  I would sit for hours building anything and everything.  This love of building has evolved as I have gotten older.  Needless to say, if you need a piece of IKEA furniture built, I'm your guy!</p>
            
            <p>I believe that a career as a software developer merges my love of technology, problem solving, and building things.  I want to become a software developer because I want to build new and innovative programs to help people and make their lives better.</p>
